The goal of the project is to extend the Beacon of Beacons (BoB) with a JavaScript (preferably AngularJS) console. 
The web console should allow the administrators to configure beacons and monitor usage of BoB. Think very simple domain-specific hawtio. 
From technological standpoint, the project is client-side JavaScript development with a touch of visualization-related work and will include contributions to the BoB frontend itself, which will publicly expose some of the generated statistics.
